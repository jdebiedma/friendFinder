# friendFinder

FriendFinder is a simple app that uses node and Express to match user-inputted values to other users who have similar tastes.

It serves as the logic for a dating site at its most basic.

The program incorporates the [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) packages.

## **Tutorial**

To use the program, click the blue "Go To Survey" button.

Type in your name and a link to a recent photo of yourself.

Once on the survey page, answer the 10 questions according to how closely you align with the presented statements.

**1** to indicate a **complete disagreement**.

**5** to indicate **complete agreement**. And so on.
